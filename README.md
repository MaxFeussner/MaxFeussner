Hi, I’m @MaxFeussner

In general I’m interested in bioinformatics and espacially in RNA bioinformatics. Furthermore, I'm also interested in different modelling methods like
genome scale metabolic reconstructions.

At the moment I'm working on CRISPR-Cas RNAs. Before, I have worked on the interesting topic of lncRNAs classification with statistical methods e.g.
unsupervised machine learning.

I’m looking to collaborate on agent-based modelling approaches because they sound really interesting and it would be nice to advance my knowledge in 
this direction.
